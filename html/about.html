                Opened my eyes on this planet on the 23rd day of December in Kathmandu, Nepal in a humble background and christened as Mehersa Sharma with a purpose not clear, as of now. Family lineage is said to have been vegetarians since last 5 generations and accordingly
                the first lesson taught was that of non-violence to any creatures, helping the downtrodden and having faith. Though as a child it was not that days passed without any small fights with fellow mates and brother. My parents always emphasized
                on having patience and winning over oneself rather than others. Looking back, I feel blessed to have been nurtured in such a wonderful school of thought.

                Schooling was exciting with all the extracurricular and co-curricular activities, imbibed. Played Wushu amongst other games securing the Red belt which not just took care of health but more so gave a sense of determination in doing whatever one pursues
                for. Teachers were always looking forward to helping us sharpen our interpersonal skills, learning and organizing skills and building the capacity of managing change with ease. Pragmatism was emphasized and encouraged us to try new things,
                though, most of our so called pragmatic thinking turned out to be crazy ideas.

                Having a social bend of mind and amongst other things, got associated with social organizations for one year and volunteered in various social activities like facilitating for the rural schools for acquiring funds for some of the required materials and
                gadgets, Public Health, Violence against Women, Disaster Management issues and the likes. These activities definitely bring a sense of satisfaction but also give a feeling that higher education would help to broaden the scope of role rather
                than landing up playing just a supportive role only of carrying Placards and being part of the crowd. Also got associated with Youth Advocacy Nepal (YAN) for one year and volunteered in various social activities
            </p>


            <p style="text-align: justify-all;">
                In this world of Computerization, with nothing but determination in mind, look forward to play a key role in not just this field but eventually society as a whole, in future.
